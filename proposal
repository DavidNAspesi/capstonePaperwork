# Capstone Proposal

## Problem Statement

Have you ever watched the Great British Baking Show and been inspired?
You wanted desperately to try to recreate some of the delicious pastries you saw on the show, 
but it seems impossible to get it right!  Home ovens just don't seem stable enough to perfect
your beautiful work.

No longer, with my new web app AccuTherm!  My web app includes a high temp thermocouple
that can be placed inside a users oven to accurately read the temperature there, and display that temperature
on a webpage.  This makes it much easier to know when your oven is up to temp instead of guessing based on the
highly inaccurate sensor that comes built into consumer ovens!  Simply place the thermocouple attachment into the oven, 
turn on the connected Raspberry Pi, and go to the website to start reading accurate temperatures in real time!

## How will AccuTherm solve the problem?

AccuTherm uses advanced IoT technology in combination with a specialty temperature sensor to deliver accurate and up to date temperatures to a user.  
Typical home ovens have a cycle time in which they are hotter than the "stated" temperature, then gradually cool down to a lower temp, and then heat up again.  
By using this sensor and the site, users can see the pattern in their oven's temperature and better understand when it has stabilized (at least, as much as it will).  
This is also applicable industrially, to things such as coffee roasters, kilns, or various tanks at breweries, etc.

## Map the User experience

Use of this sensor will be very simple.  Users will simply place the thermocouple attachment into their oven (or whatever it is they are trying to get a reading for).  
Upon turning the device on via the provided power switch, the device will immediately start sending data to the provided URL.  All the user has to do is navigate on their
computer or mobile device to that page, and they have the data for themselves!  The webpage will have options for basic data manipulation, such as readings in Celsius or Fahrenheit, as well as
a database that will store readings from that entire "session".

## What technologies do you plan to use?

Raspbian OS, Python, AWS, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PostgresQL OR SQLite, Vue.js
